- good day, I'm Kganyamayeza

I'm passionate about building robust and scalable systems, with a focus on both frontend and backend development. My journey in software is driven by curiosity and an ambition to engineer solutions that make a real-world impact—especially in industries where precision and reliability matter, like banking and financial technology.

## About Me

- I work across the stack, with a keen interest in advanced frameworks and architectures.
- My approach to development is grounded in best practices, clean code, and a forward-looking mindset.
- I am actively preparing for a career as a software engineer, with an eye on opportunities to help shape the future of banking systems and other mission-critical applications.

## Technical Skills

- TypeScript & JavaScript (ESNext)
- React & Next.js for advanced frontend development
- Node.js, Express, and serverless architectures
- REST APIs, GraphQL, and real-time data solutions
- Modern database systems (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- Automated testing, CI/CD, and cloud deployment

> I prioritize learning and applying new technologies that push the boundaries of what’s possible in software engineering.

## Life Outside of Code

When I’m not at the keyboard, you’ll find me staying active—on the basketball court, the soccer field, boxing, or at the gym. I believe that discipline and balance are just as important in life as they are in code.
